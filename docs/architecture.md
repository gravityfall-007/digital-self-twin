# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the **Digital Self Avatar** project architecture. It explains the key components, their interactions, and the overall workflow.

## **Components**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **YouTube Video Downloader**: Downloads videos from a specified YouTube playlist.
   - **Audio Extractor**: Extracts audio from the downloaded videos.
   - **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Transcribes the extracted audio into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.
   - **Frame Extractor**: Extracts video frames for facial animation.
   - **Face Detection and Alignment**: Detects and aligns faces in the extracted frames.

### 2. **Model Training**
   - **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Trains a model to generate speech in the individual's voice.
   - **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Fine-tunes a pre-trained STT model for better transcription accuracy.
   - **Facial Animation**: Trains a model to generate facial animations based on text or audio input.
   - **Conversational AI**: Fine-tunes a language model (e.g., GPT) to enable natural conversations.

### 3. **Application**
   - **Backend**: A FastAPI server that handles requests, processes data, and communicates with the models.
   - **Frontend**: A user interface for interacting with the digital avatar (e.g., chat interface).
   - **Avatar Engine**: Renders the digital avatar and synchronizes facial animations with speech.

## **Workflow**

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Videos are downloaded from a YouTube playlist.
   - Audio and frames are extracted from the videos.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Audio is transcribed into text.
   - Frames are processed for face detection and alignment.

3. **Model Training**:
   - TTS, STT, facial animation, and conversational AI models are trained using the processed data.

4. **Deployment**:
   - The backend server is deployed to handle user requests.
   - The frontend interface is hosted for user interaction.
   - The avatar engine renders the digital avatar in real-time.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **PyTorch**: For training deep learning models.
- **FastAPI**: For the backend server.
- **Whisper**: For speech-to-text transcription.
- **OpenCV**: For video and image processing.
- **React**: For the frontend interface (optional).
